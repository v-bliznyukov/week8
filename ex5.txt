VIRTUAL addresses are the addresses GENERATED BY A PROGRAM and they form virtual address space. In computers without virtual memory, 
these addresses are mapped to same PHYSICAL addresses, which are ACTUAL MEMORY LOCATIONS.
However, with vurtual memory Memory Management Unit, virtual address are mapped to physical addresses, that can be drastically different. 
Virtual address space of a process does not consider size of physical address space, which can be smaller,
and its the job of MMU to map virtual addresses and physical ones in order to provide same performane (almost same) as if there were, for example, enough or more memory.
